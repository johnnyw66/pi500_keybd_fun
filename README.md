### Keyboard Message Board
Use your PI500+ keyboard as a crude display.

Examples

**message_board.py** scroll messages across the keyboard. Use it with MQTT and NodeRed to produce alerts or notifications.

**anim.py** Simple Animation class - useful for showing simple GIFs on your keyboard.
